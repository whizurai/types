/**
 * Speech Synthesis Capability Types
 *
 * Platform capability `speech:synthesize@v1` — text to speech on the local
 * fleet. Asynchronous: `capabilities.run` returns a run; the audio is an
 * artifact. The capability is gated by `ENABLE_SPEECH_SYNTHESIS` on the
 * platform (default off), so a client may see it only once enabled.
 *
 * The shapes are flat and camelCase. The platform rejects unknown input
 * fields rather than dropping them, so a misspelt option fails loudly.
